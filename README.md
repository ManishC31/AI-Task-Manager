## 🤖 How It Works

When a user writes a description of an issue or task, TaskMind AI's advanced AI engine:

- **Generates a Clear Title:** Automatically summarizes the issue into a concise, relevant title.
- **Refines the Description:** Enhances and structures the issue description for clarity and completeness.
- **Assigns to the Right Developer:** Analyzes team members' skills, workload, and history to assign the issue to the most suitable developer.

This automation reduces manual effort, eliminates ambiguity, and ensures tasks are distributed optimally across your team.
